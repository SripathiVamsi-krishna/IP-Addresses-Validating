# IP-Addresses-Validating


Hi Viewers, In this project, I have tried to do the validation to the IP address that we enter in the input area. This will Start like:

             Takes the input and validates by the IP address by the length(total) and individual lengths. If it is valid then it will be splitted into four parts where the program will convert the each division into four conversion(Decimal, Binary, Hexa, OCtal). All these conversions of each split will be stored in to a List. And After that the lists will be stored in to another list whoch makes the four seperate lists into one. 
             
             If the input is invalid, then the whole program gets terminated!!! 
             
             
             Try running the program you will get to  know the architecture of that.
